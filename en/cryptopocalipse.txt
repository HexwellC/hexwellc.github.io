In August, there was an insightful talk titled "The Factoring Dead: Preparing
for the Cryptopocalypse". They discussed the inevitable fall of RSA crypto 
because of it's weakness to the quantum algorithms. It sounds unreal but we 
should take this imminent threat seriously, but moving toward
ECC (elliptic curve cryptography) has it's own troubles:

1. "The RSA way" is dangerous. Relyinng on ANY single algorithm is a risk 
nobody can afford to take on the internet. That's pretty obvious, and 
leading scientists has been saying the same for a while (William Whyte, 
for example)

2. EEC is doomed when quantum computers will arrive. It's not fully resistant 
and it's dangerous to rely on it.

Today, when we have free processing power and free channel capacity, it's 
dangerous to have a jerk saying "the algorithm we all depend on today is 
looking shaky - let's all go epend solely on a different algorithm!". We 
should take advandage of modern processors and bandwidgth and think how we 
build and Internet that is cryptographically robust, even if one of trusted 
algorithms gets broken. If not, we're going to stuck in a cancerous loop. 
It's exponentially crazy to rely entirely on ECC as a single algorithm. The 
correct way to go is to create a modular protocol with multiple algorithms
running in parallel, for example, ECC with NTRU. 

Basically, this article is highly inspired by William's Whyte's article

ECC isn't so secure as you might think
