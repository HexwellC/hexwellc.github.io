If Linux wasn't about choice, you wouldn't been able even to know RedHat. Yes, Linux 
_is_ about choice, and you just don't want to realize the truth. Linux _was_ created for 
making choices instead of listening to the OS owners. That's how entire open source 
software ecosystem works - each user has a choice.

As a consumer, yes, you have lots of choices. Period. And you should always have. 
Independently from distros. Distros owners shouldn't push their point of view, they are 
just voluntary slaves. Software _is_ hard and you cannot just force users to use 
PulseAudio like Firefox do. It's time to stop. Software ought to be hard. You are 
allowed to simplify it, but we're all will be paying a price.

Yes, you should ship everything and let the user choose. Yes, this is cancer. Deal with 
it, choice is always a cancer, but you cannot just carve up it like a regular cancer. 
Linux is about true democracy and liberalism, and what you're doing is actually 
infringement of human rights. It's time to stop.
